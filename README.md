# GDExtension-Flake

This flake is designed to work as a reproducable development environment for creating extensions for the Godot Engine in C++. 

This flake is based on the CMake template @ZacharieBeauchemin created for GDExtension to be used with CLion. As I am attempting to personally switch from CLion to nvim as
well as recently making the jump to NixOS, I felt it would be a great project to become familiar with Nix-Shell's and better understand how flakes can be used to create 
development environments.

Note! Godot won't be able to run in the shell unless you have the godot_4 package from the nix-unstable channel. With that, even if you have it and run `sudo nix develop`, godot_4 will not be able to start. 
If anyone knows how to fix this then please make a pull request so the community can benefit from your extremely massive brain.

### Requirements:
    Linux with Nix installed with nix commands and flakes enabled. 

### The DevShell contians the following packages

 - nvim - This Flake uses my custom configured NixVim natively with plugins already installed and configured. 
 - cmake - because I personally despise using SCons.
 - gcc - Feel free to replace this with Clang if you wish.
 - godot - Version 4.3 from the nix-unstable channel.
 - ninja - My prefered build tool.
 - git - needed for the cmake scripts to fetch content properly.
 

### Instructions:
To use this template, either clone or download it; truly do whatever your heart desires to grab it.
open terminal in the repo's directory.
OPTIONAL: Change the ProjectName in the CMakeLists.txt to whatever you please, this will be used for your libraries name.

1. run `nix develop`
2. cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$(which gcc) -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$(which g++) ..
3. when that's all done, run `ninja` and it should start compiling the provided GDExtension and GodotCPP for godot 4.3
4. Source code for the extension will live in the "game" folder.
5. Star this repo template ðŸ˜ˆ
